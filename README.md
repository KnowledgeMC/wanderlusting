###Description:
Wanderlusting is a fullstack Ruby on Rails application where users can post Travel pics, as well as view and comment on other users' posts.  It is essentially a travel-focused Instagram clone. 

###Technologies Used:
* Ruby on Rails 
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* SASS
* Paperclip
* Postgresql
* Heroku

###Unsolved Problems:
* Users can delete any other user's posts.
* Users cannot edit their posts.

###Next Steps/Planned Features:
* Fix authentication problem so that users may only delete their own posts
* Fix "edit" link, so that users can edit their own posts.
* Add ability for users to follow other users.
* Add ability to map and display location of where the picture was taken.
* Add "bucket-list" feature where users can "collect" interesting places to travel to in the future.
